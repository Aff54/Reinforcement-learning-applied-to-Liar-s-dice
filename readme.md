# Learning Liar's dice with deep Q-learning

A reinforcement learning application to Liar's Dice.

## Overview
This project explores the application of deep reinforcement learning to Liar’s Dice, a dice and bet-based imperfect-information game.  
Current document presents Liar's dice game mechanics, reinforcement learning theory with deep learning components and their application. 
The demo notebook showcases how to use the code I wrote for simulating games and training an agent using deep reinforcement learning.

## Key Features
- Custom Liar’s Dice game environment in Python.
- Deterministic and random baseline opponents.
- Visual tools for data analysis.
- Reinforcement learning modeling (state format, episode definition, reward definition).
- DDQN (double DQN) algorithm implementation in PyTorch.
- Context specific training and testing metrics.
- Detailed analysis in an interactive notebook.
